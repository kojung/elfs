# Extensible Laser Firing System

Extensible Laser Firing System (ELFS) is an open source project intended to make firing practice fun and affordable at home. The project consists of one or more light dependent resistors acting as shooting targets. LED, actuators and a GUI act as feedback mechanism.

This is the simplified branch with 4 sensors and 1 actuator.
